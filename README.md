# Parallel-and-Distributed-Systems

This repository contains projects on parallelizing algorithms using C libraries such as: Pthreads, OpenMP, Intel Cilk, OpenMPI, Nvidia CUDA. 

Those projects involve individual work as part of the Parallel and Distributed Systems course of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

Academic Year: 2017-2018

## A Brief Description 
Each projects is about parallelizing a serial C algorithm (which is also to be implemented) by utilizing certain techniques and libraries.

* **Project 1:** Bitonic Sort (Imperative & Recursive) - Pthreads, OpenMP, Intel Cilk, Hybrid 
* **Project 2:** K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) - OpenMPI, Hybrid 
* **Project 3:** Meanshift - CUDA, Hybrid 
* **Project 4:** Non Local Means - CUDA, Hybrid
